# Engine Game Jam 2019


## Game Info

Information about the game was here.

Built with ♥️, Phaser 3 and TypeScript

## Dev Info

- Use `npm install pre-commit`
- Use `.eslintrc.json` & `.prettierrc` 
- Any "keys" or "id" in `.env` and share the .env on `keybase`
- Try to minify & compress assets before uploading `tinypng assets -r -k <KEY>` 
- Use place holder assets as these will be swapped for the real assets

- Keep all assets in the `objects.ts` as a json object, this makes it easier to load all images and can be referenced everywhere. 
- Save game status in `game-state.ts` ?
- Keep all scenes under `src/scenes`
- Try to create re-usable objects `e.g Character Sprites`
